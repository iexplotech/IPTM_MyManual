#### Initial Setup: Download Files ####
# Open command line (Linux Terminal). Follow exactly this command!
# All Steps must be successfull!

# 1. Basic Setup: Create new linux user account
// Assume that you already install ssh server in your remote Cloud VM. Existed by default.
// Now you want to setup new user account for IPTM node client. Never use root account for non-system configuration works.
whoami
sudo -i
useradd -m -d /home/user user -p 123456    // add new account, user is the account name
passwd user    // change user password, write somewhere at safe place the new password of user account 
apt-get install sudo
usermod -aG sudo user
getent group | grep sudo
su user
bash
whoami
cd ~
pwd


# 2. Afterthat you may close ssh terminal. Sometime you need to restart your linux to make password change affect. 
// Then try to re-login using new user account. For google cloud, just use web terminal provided by Google Cloud.


# 3. Setup Remote Terminal using screen
// To connect remote VM, we use ssh. However, when we close ssh terminal or internet disconnected,
// the current running application inside ssh terminal will be terminated together with ssl.
// to avoid this problem, we use screen terminal whereby the screen still running even though 
// ssl terminated. Therefore, if you are running IPTM node remotely, you MUST use screen! 

## remote your vm and run as 'user' account. For Google cloud, just use web terminal provided by Google Cloud.

## install screen
sudo apt-get install screen

## Start screen
screen     // you need to press spacebar, use terminal wrapped by screen

## List all active screens
screen -ls

## Resume screen 
screen -ls
screen -r  <id>

## Detach screen (switch between screen)
CTR + A
CTR + D
